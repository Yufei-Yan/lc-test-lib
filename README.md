# Leetcode Test Library

For those people who practice coding on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com), it becomes difficult for debugging code locally with various types of input, such as ```linked list```, ```binary tree``` and ```string arrays```.

Programmers will have to assemble the above data structures for debugging or testing. This could be quite time consuming.

To mitigate the problem for myself when I happen to kill time on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) and have difficulty in solving problems with limited test cases from the the website, I developed such a tool for me to locally debug my program.

Please refer [API](https://github.com/Yufei-Yan/lc-test-lib/blob/master/doc/index.html) for usage in detail.
