# Leetcode Test Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Yufei-Yan/lc-test-lib.svg?token=XcP5JJDxyxtt6poz3NWD&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Yufei-Yan/lc-test-lib)

For those people who practice coding on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com), it becomes difficult for debugging code locally with various types of input, such as ```linked list```, ```binary tree``` and ```string arrays```.

Programmers will have to assemble the above data structures for debugging or testing. This could be quite time consuming.

To mitigate the problem for myself when I happen to kill time on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) and have difficulty in solving problems with limited test cases from the the website, I developed such a tool for me to locally debug my program.

Please refer [API](./doc/index.html) for usage in detail.
